This is a web application that hosts an interpreter for and simulates between the lambda calculus and Turing machine. The web application can either simulate from the lambda calculus to the multi-tape Turing machine or from the single-tape Turing machine to the weak lambda calculus, using the methods outlined by Dal Lago and Martini in their paper ["The Weak Lambda Calculus as a Reasonable Machine"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.tcs.2008.01.044).

- Built in **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
- User Interface built with **Bootstrap**, **JQuery**, **JQuery Terminal** and **FullPages**
- Tested using **Jest** and **Node.JS**

## GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The lambda calculus interpreter uses an applicative-order evaluation strategy to perform beta reduction. The interpreter can reduce complicated lambda expressions, highlight the parameter and argument of a reduction, and simulate SKI combinators and boolean logic.

The TM interpter works using a JSON-based terminal as outlined by Chad Palmer in his article 'A Complete Web Page: Building a Turing Machine in JavaScript'. The TM interperter can visualise the run of the TM by simulating the movement of the machine head on the tape.

The multi-tape TM interpreter is used for simulating the lambda calculus term in a Turing machine. The lambda term reduced by the multi-tape interpreter is similar in format to the De Brujin indices.  

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR SIMULATING TURING MACHINE (TM) IN THE LAMBDA CALCULUS

1. In the `Single-Tape Turing Machine Interpreter`, run a TM using either an example in the drop-down list or create a TM of your own

2. In the `Lambda Calculus Interpreter`, enter 'T' to denote the beginning of the TM as a lambda term

3. In the `Lambda Calculus Interpreter`, enter to the right of 'T' the tape you want to run:

        T101

4. Run the `Lambda Calculus Interpreter`

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR SIMULATING LAMBDA CALCULUS IN THE MULTI-TAPE TURING MACHINE (TM)

1. In the `Lambda Calculus Interpreter`, enter the lambda calculus term being converted.

2. In the `Multi-Tape Turing Machine Interpreter`, the lambda calculus term previously entered should now be converted into its Dal Lago and Martini notation

3. Run the `Multi-Tape Turing Machine Interpreter`

4. The tape of the interpreter at the halting state will be the weak head normal form of the lambda calculus term in Dal Lago and Martini notation
